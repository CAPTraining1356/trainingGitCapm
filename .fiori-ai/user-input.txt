Scenario Overview

Create a sample SAP BTP CAPM application that:

Displays a list of books with their respective authors.
Allows users to select books for placing orders.
Provides "Accept" and "Reject" buttons at the bottom of the UI to process the selected orders.
The buttons should update the order status and reflect the changes in the system.

Step 1: Define the Application Requirements
Data Model:

Include entities for Books and Authors.
Define an entity for Orders to manage book orders with fields like:
Book ID (reference to the book being ordered).
Status (Pending, Accepted, Rejected).
Order Quantity.
Actions:

Accept: Updates the status of selected orders to "Accepted."
Reject: Updates the status of selected orders to "Rejected."
Step 2: Set Up the Backend Service
Expose Data:

A service should expose:
A list of books with author information.
Orders related to books.
Support querying and filtering books and orders.
Implement Actions:

Backend logic for:
Accepting selected orders by updating their status to "Accepted."
Rejecting selected orders by updating their status to "Rejected."
Validation:

Ensure that actions are idempotent (cannot re-accept or re-reject).
Handle invalid or missing order IDs gracefully.
Step 3: Add UI Annotations for Fiori Elements
List Report:

Configure the main view to display:
List of books with fields like Title, Author Name, Price, and Quantity.
Allow users to select multiple rows.
Action Buttons:

Add "Accept" and "Reject" buttons at the bottom of the page.
Bind these buttons to the backend actions.
Object Page:

Configure a detailed view for each book, showing additional details like a summary or genre.
Step 4: Generate the Fiori Elements App
Use the App Generator:

Open SAP Business Application Studio and create a new Fiori Elements app.
Bind the app to the backend service that provides book and order data.
Select the List Report template.
Enable multi-select functionality in the List Report.
Customize the Generated App:

Ensure that "Accept" and "Reject" buttons are displayed at the bottom of the List Report.
Test the integration with the backend actions.
Step 5: Test Locally
Run the Backend:
Start the CAPM service locally using cds run.
Run the App:
Start the Fiori app in preview mode (npm start).
Verify that:
Books and their authors are displayed in the List Report.
"Accept" and "Reject" buttons are visible and functional.
Selecting books and clicking the buttons updates the order status correctly.
Step 6: Deploy the Application to SAP Cloud Foundry
Prepare the Project:
Configure deployment settings in the mta.yaml file.
Build and Deploy:
Build the application into an MTA archive using mbt build.
Deploy it to Cloud Foundry using cf deploy.
Access the Deployed App:
Test the app through the SAP Launchpad or direct URL.
Expected Outcome
A List Report displays all available books with their authors.
Users can select multiple books and place orders.
"Accept" and "Reject" buttons:
Process the selected orders and update their statuses.
Reflect changes in the List Report after execution.
