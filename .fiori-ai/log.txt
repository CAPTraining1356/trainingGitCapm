==========LLM call for step "extractAppSkeleton":==========
You help the user building a Fiori Elements application described in the user input.

A Fiori Elements application typically starts with a ListReport page showing the data of the base entity of the application in a table.
Details of a specific table row are shown in the ObjectPage. This first ObjectPage is therefore based on the base entity of the application.
An ObjectPage can contain one or more table sections based on to-many associations of its entity type.
The details of a table section row can be shown in an another ObjectPage based on the associations target entity.

Your task is to find the entities (with their to-many associations) as well as the ObjectPages (with the to-many associations they use in table sections) described in the user input below.

You must format your output as a JSON value that adheres to a given "JSON Schema" instance.

"JSON Schema" is a declarative language that allows you to annotate and validate JSON documents.

For example, the example "JSON Schema" instance {{"properties": {{"foo": {{"description": "a list of test words", "type": "array", "items": {{"type": "string"}}}}}}, "required": ["foo"]}}
would match an object with one required property, "foo". The "type" property specifies "foo" must be an "array", and the "description" property semantically describes it as "a list of test words". The items within "foo" must be strings.
Thus, the object {{"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is a well-formatted instance of this example "JSON Schema". The object {{"properties": {{"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}}}} is not well-formatted.

Your output will be parsed and type-checked according to the provided schema instance, so make sure all fields in your output match the schema exactly and there are no trailing commas!

Here is the JSON Schema instance your output must adhere to. Include the enclosing markdown codeblock:

Scenario Overview

Create a sample SAP BTP CAPM application that:

Displays a list of books with their respective authors.
Allows users to select books for placing orders.
Provides "Accept" and "Reject" buttons at the bottom of the UI to process the selected orders.
The buttons should update the order status and reflect the changes in the system.

Step 1: Define the Application Requirements
Data Model:

Include entities for Books and Authors.
Define an entity for Orders to manage book orders with fields like:
Book ID (reference to the book being ordered).
Status (Pending, Accepted, Rejected).
Order Quantity.
Actions:

Accept: Updates the status of selected orders to "Accepted."
Reject: Updates the status of selected orders to "Rejected."
Step 2: Set Up the Backend Service
Expose Data:

A service should expose:
A list of books with author information.
Orders related to books.
Support querying and filtering books and orders.
Implement Actions:

Backend logic for:
Accepting selected orders by updating their status to "Accepted."
Rejecting selected orders by updating their status to "Rejected."
Validation:

Ensure that actions are idempotent (cannot re-accept or re-reject).
Handle invalid or missing order IDs gracefully.
Step 3: Add UI Annotations for Fiori Elements
List Report:

Configure the main view to display:
List of books with fields like Title, Author Name, Price, and Quantity.
Allow users to select multiple rows.
Action Buttons:

Add "Accept" and "Reject" buttons at the bottom of the page.
Bind these buttons to the backend actions.
Object Page:

Configure a detailed view for each book, showing additional details like a summary or genre.
Step 4: Generate the Fiori Elements App
Use the App Generator:

Open SAP Business Application Studio and create a new Fiori Elements app.
Bind the app to the backend service that provides book and order data.
Select the List Report template.
Enable multi-select functionality in the List Report.
Customize the Generated App:

Ensure that "Accept" and "Reject" buttons are displayed at the bottom of the List Report.
Test the integration with the backend actions.
Step 5: Test Locally
Run the Backend:
Start the CAPM service locally using cds run.
Run the App:
Start the Fiori app in preview mode (npm start).
Verify that:
Books and their authors are displayed in the List Report.
"Accept" and "Reject" buttons are visible and functional.
Selecting books and clicking the buttons updates the order status correctly.
Step 6: Deploy the Application to SAP Cloud Foundry
Prepare the Project:
Configure deployment settings in the mta.yaml file.
Build and Deploy:
Build the application into an MTA archive using mbt build.
Deploy it to Cloud Foundry using cf deploy.
Access the Deployed App:
Test the app through the SAP Launchpad or direct URL.
Expected Outcome
A List Report displays all available books with their authors.
Users can select multiple books and place orders.
"Accept" and "Reject" buttons:
Process the selected orders and update their statuses.
Reflect changes in the List Report after execution.

==========LLM call for step "extractEntitiesProperties":==========
You help the user refining the DataModel for a Fiori Elements application described in the user input.

The DataModel consists of the following entities and associations:
- entity "Books" (with to-many associations to "Authors" and to-one association to "Orders")
- entity "Authors" (with to-one association to "Books")
- entity "Orders" (with to-many associations to "Books")

==========LLM call for classifier:==========
The user input below describes a Fiori Elements application with a ListReport page and multiple ObjectPages.
ListReport page shows the data of the specific business object as a list or table. ObjectPage shows details of a specific business object instance.
Your task is to classify the lines based on the same business object representation to the following categories, one line can refer only to a single category:
 - LIST_REPORT_BOOKS: line describes the ListReport page for "Books"
 - OBJECT_PAGE_BOOKS: line describes the ObjectPage for "Books" with a table of "Authors"
 - NONE: line is not describing any ListReport page or ObjectPage

Return your findings as csv file with columns "lineContent" and "category"!

<UserInput>
Scenario Overview

Create a sample SAP BTP CAPM application that:

Displays a list of books with their respective authors.
Allows users to select books for placing orders.
Provides "Accept" and "Reject" buttons at the bottom of the UI to process the selected orders.
The buttons should update the order status and reflect the changes in the system.

Step 1: Define the Application Requirements
Data Model:

Include entities for Books and Authors.
Define an entity for Orders to manage book orders with fields like:
Book ID (reference to the book being ordered).
Status (Pending, Accepted, Rejected).
Order Quantity.
Actions:

Accept: Updates the status of selected orders to "Accepted."
Reject: Updates the status of selected orders to "Rejected."
Step 2: Set Up the Backend Service
Expose Data:

A service should expose:
A list of books with author information.
Orders related to books.
Support querying and filtering books and orders.
Implement Actions:

Backend logic for:
Accepting selected orders by updating their status to "Accepted."
Rejecting selected orders by updating their status to "Rejected."
Validation:

Ensure that actions are idempotent (cannot re-accept or re-reject).
Handle invalid or missing order IDs gracefully.
Step 3: Add UI Annotations for Fiori Elements
List Report:

Configure the main view to display:
List of books with fields like Title, Author Name, Price, and Quantity.
Allow users to select multiple rows.
Action Buttons:

Add "Accept" and "Reject" buttons at the bottom of the page.
Bind these buttons to the backend actions.
Object Page:

Configure a detailed view for each book, showing additional details like a summary or genre.
Step 4: Generate the Fiori Elements App
Use the App Generator:

Open SAP Business Application Studio and create a new Fiori Elements app.
Bind the app to the backend service that provides book and order data.
Select the List Report template.
Enable multi-select functionality in the List Report.
Customize the Generated App:

Ensure that "Accept" and "Reject" buttons are displayed at the bottom of the List Report.
Test the integration with the backend actions.
Step 5: Test Locally
Run the Backend:
Start the CAPM service locally using cds run.
Run the App:
Start the Fiori app in preview mode (npm start).
Verify that:
Books and their authors are displayed in the List Report.
"Accept" and "Reject" buttons are visible and functional.
Selecting books and clicking the buttons updates the order status correctly.
Step 6: Deploy the Application to SAP Cloud Foundry
Prepare the Project:
Configure deployment settings in the mta.yaml file.
Build and Deploy:
Build the application into an MTA archive using mbt build.
Deploy it to Cloud Foundry using cf deploy.
Access the Deployed App:
Test the app through the SAP Launchpad or direct URL.
Expected Outcome
A List Report displays all available books with their authors.
Users can select multiple books and place orders.
"Accept" and "Reject" buttons:
Process the selected orders and update their statuses.
Reflect changes in the List Report after execution.

The user input below describes the details of the ListReport page (i.e. its filters, tables or views with their columns).

Your task is to help the user defining the ListReport page.

You must format your output as a JSON value that adheres to a given "JSON Schema" instance.

"JSON Schema" is a declarative language that allows you to annotate and validate JSON documents.

For example, the example "JSON Schema" instance {{"properties": {{"foo": {{"description": "a list of test words", "type": "array", "items": {{"type": "string"}}}}}}, "required": ["foo"]}}
would match an object with one required property, "foo". The "type" property specifies "foo" must be an "array", and the "description" property semantically describes it as "a list of test words". The items within "foo" must be strings.
Thus, the object {{"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is a well-formatted instance of this example "JSON Schema". The object {{"properties": {{"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}}}} is not well-formatted.

Your output will be parsed and type-checked according to the provided schema instance, so make sure all fields in your output match the schema exactly and there are no trailing commas!

Here is the JSON Schema instance your output must adhere to. Include the enclosing markdown codeblock:
```json

Your task is to find the details of the ObjectPage for "Books".
The base entity of the ObjectPage is Books.
This ObjectPage can contain tabs and/or sections which in turn contain tables and fields.
It must contain table sections containing data for associated entity "Authors" (via association authors);

The underlying data model allows the following propertyPaths:
 - bookID: Book ID (of Book)
 - title: Title (of Book)
 - authorName: Author Name (of Book)
 - price: Price (of Book)
 - quantity: Quantity (of Book)
 - authors/authorID: Author ID (of many associated Author)

Displays a list of books with their respective authors.
Allows users to select books for placing orders.
Provides "Accept" and "Reject" buttons at the bottom of the UI to process the selected orders.
The buttons should update the order status and reflect the changes in the system.

Step 1: Define the Application Requirements
Data Model:

Include entities for Books and Authors.
Define an entity for Orders to manage book orders with fields like:
Book ID (reference to the book being ordered).
Status (Pending, Accepted, Rejected).
Order Quantity.
Actions:

Accept: Updates the status of selected orders to "Accepted."
Reject: Updates the status of selected orders to "Rejected."
Step 2: Set Up the Backend Service
Expose Data:

A service should expose:
A list of books with author information.
Orders related to books.
Support querying and filtering books and orders.
Implement Actions:

Backend logic for:
Accepting selected orders by updating their status to "Accepted."
Rejecting selected orders by updating their status to "Rejected."
Validation:

Ensure that actions are idempotent (cannot re-accept or re-reject).
Handle invalid or missing order IDs gracefully.
Step 3: Add UI Annotations for Fiori Elements
List Report:

Configure the main view to display:
List of books with fields like Title, Author Name, Price, and Quantity.
Allow users to select multiple rows.
Action Buttons:

Add "Accept" and "Reject" buttons at the bottom of the page.
Bind these buttons to the backend actions.
Object Page:

Configure a detailed view for each book, showing additional details like a summary or genre.
Step 4: Generate the Fiori Elements App
Use the App Generator:

Open SAP Business Application Studio and create a new Fiori Elements app.
Bind the app to the backend service that provides book and order data.
Select the List Report template.
Enable multi-select functionality in the List Report.
Customize the Generated App:

Ensure that "Accept" and "Reject" buttons are displayed at the bottom of the List Report.
Test the integration with the backend actions.
Step 5: Test Locally
Run the Backend:
Start the CAPM service locally using cds run.
Run the App:
Start the Fiori app in preview mode (npm start).
Verify that:
Books and their authors are displayed in the List Report.
"Accept" and "Reject" buttons are visible and functional.
Selecting books and clicking the buttons updates the order status correctly.
Step 6: Deploy the Application to SAP Cloud Foundry
Prepare the Project:
Configure deployment settings in the mta.yaml file.
Build and Deploy:
Build the application into an MTA archive using mbt build.
Deploy it to Cloud Foundry using cf deploy.
Access the Deployed App:
Test the app through the SAP Launchpad or direct URL.
Expected Outcome
A List Report displays all available books with their authors.
Users can select multiple books and place orders.
"Accept" and "Reject" buttons:
Process the selected orders and update their statuses.
Reflect changes in the List Report after execution.

==========LLM call for data generation:==========

For the following list of entities, create data for the empty CSV files.
Entity "Books" - Properties:
    bookID: String(50), Unique identifier for each book
    title: String(100), Title of the book
    authorName: String(100), Name of the author of the book
    price: Decimal, Price of the book
    quantity: Integer, Available quantity of the book
    orders_orderID: String(50), orderID of associated Orders

Entity "Authors" - Properties:
    authorID: String(50), Unique identifier for each author
    name: String(100), Name of the author
    books_bookID: String(50), bookID of associated Books

Entity "Orders" - Properties:
    orderID: String(50), Unique identifier for each order
    bookID: String(50), Reference to the book being ordered
    status: String(20), Status of the order (Pending, Accepted, Rejected)
    orderQuantity: Integer, Quantity of books ordered

Empty CSV files in json format (only generate content for these files!):
{"Books.csv":"bookID;title;authorName;price;quantity;orders_orderID","Authors.csv":"authorID;name;books_bookID","Orders.csv":"orderID;bookID;status;orderQuantity"}

Rules:
    - Take over the given header line, do not invent new columns!
    - For a given file, add rows, add '\n' characters before each row but don't break the JSON string
    - Do not generate rows with same key values, they must be unique!
    - Make sure that associations match, i.e. a field containing "Name of the associated Customer" must contain an existing Name of entity Customer
    - Always use ";" as a delimiter in CSV files
    - The result must be proper JSON format so it can be parsed, don't break JSON strings within, don't add quotes around values.
    - Create about 5 rows for the first csv, 7 for the second and so on
    - All values must be realistic with meaningful content, e.g. 'Laptop Screen' and not just placeholder values with incremented numbers like 'Product 1', 'Product 2' etc.
    
Use format for values:
  String(50): string no longer than 50 characters
  Decimal(3,2): 1.23
  Integer, Double: only numbers, no special symbols
    
For the following fields, use only the supplied allowed values (as they are, don't insert spaces or change case):
- status (of Orders): Pending, Accepted, Rejected

Example output (Do NOT include in output!):
```json
